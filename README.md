Digital Lost & Found System (FoundIt)

This is a simple Java project I’m building to learn how to manage real-world problems. The idea is to let people log items they’ve found so others who lost them can maybe retrieve them — kind of like a digital version of a lost-and-found box.

Right now, it runs on the command line, but I’m planning to improve it over time by adding things like file saving, maybe a GUI, and even a search feature later on.

 What It Does
 Takes user input for:
  - Item name
  - Where it was found
  - Contact info
  - Date found
 Stores the data using a class with private variables and a constructor
 Prints the info back for confirmation

Why I’m Building This

I’m learning Java and wanted a project that’s not just "print Hello World" or "calculate area of a circle". This project helps me practice:
- Classes and constructors
- Working with multiple `.java` files
- Taking input using `Scanner`
- Connecting real-life ideas to code

How to Run

1. Clone or download this repo
2. Open a terminal in the folder
3. Compile both files:
   javac Founditem.java
   javac Main.java
4. Run the project:

Future Plans 
- Add `toString()` method for cleaner output
- Create a list of multiple found items
- Add file saving
- Build a simple GUI with JavaFX or Swing
- Maybe even connect a database later on

## Note

This is a work in progress, and I’m doing this mainly to learn and grow. If you have feedback or suggestions, feel free to share!
